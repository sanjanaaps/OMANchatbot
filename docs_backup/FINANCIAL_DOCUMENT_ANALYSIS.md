## Analysis Template

When a financial document is detected, the system uses the following structured prompt template:

```
Analyze this financial document and extract key information:

DOCUMENT: {document_content}

**DOCUMENT ANALYSIS:**
- Type: [Auto-detect: Invoice/Wire Transfer/Loan Payment/Remittance/Statement/Other]
- Reference/ID: 
- Date: 
- Status: 

**FINANCIAL SUMMARY:**
- Main Amount: 
- Currency: 
- From: 
- To: 
- Purpose: 

**DETAILED BREAKDOWN:**
- Account Numbers: 
- Transaction ID: 
- Fees/Interest/Tax: 
- Payment Method: 
- Due Dates: 
- Balance Information: 

**KEY FINDINGS:**
Extract 3-5 most important pieces of information based on document type:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

**SUMMARY:**
[2-3 sentence overview of the document's purpose and financial impact]

RULES: Use only information visible in the document. Mark unclear items as "Unclear" and missing items as "Not specified".
```

## How It Works

### 1. Document Detection
When a document is uploaded, the system:
- Analyzes the filename for financial keywords
- Scans the document content for financial patterns
- Detects amounts, dates, account numbers, and transaction references
- Determines if it's a financial document

### 2. Analysis Process
For detected financial documents:
1. **Primary Analysis**: Uses Gemini AI with the specialized prompt template
2. **Fallback Analysis**: If Gemini fails, uses local pattern-based analysis
3. **Final Fallback**: Basic analysis with extracted information

### 3. Document Storage
The system stores:
- Original document content
- Detected document type
- Generated analysis/summary
- Department and user information

## Implementation Details

### New Functions Added

#### `analyze_financial_document(text, department, language)`
- Main function for financial document analysis
- Uses Gemini AI with specialized prompt
- Includes fallback mechanisms

#### `detect_financial_document_type(filename, text)`
- Detects if document is financial
- Returns specific document type
- Uses keyword matching and pattern recognition

#### `generate_local_financial_analysis(text, department, language)`
- Fallback analysis when Gemini is unavailable
- Extracts financial patterns using regex
- Provides structured output

#### `generate_fallback_financial_analysis(text, department, language)`
- Final fallback for basic analysis
- Ensures system always provides some analysis

### Database Changes

#### Document Model Updates
- Added `document_type` field to store detected financial document type
- Updated `to_dict()` method to include document type

### Integration Points

#### Upload Route (`/upload`)
- Detects financial documents during upload
- Applies appropriate analysis based on document type
- Stores document type in database
- Uses financial analysis for financial documents
- Falls back to structured analysis for other PDFs
- Uses regular summary for non-financial documents

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Bank Statement
```
Input: bank_statement_2024.pdf
Content: "Bank Statement for Account 123456789, Balance: $5,000.00..."

Output:
**DOCUMENT ANALYSIS:**
- Type: Statement
- Reference/ID: STMT-2024-001
- Date: 2024-01-31
- Status: Current

**FINANCIAL SUMMARY:**
- Main Amount: $5,000.00
- Currency: USD
- From: Bank Account
- To: Account Holder
- Purpose: Monthly Statement
```

### Example 2: Wire Transfer
```
Input: wire_transfer_confirmation.pdf
Content: "Wire Transfer Confirmation, Amount: $10,000.00..."

Output:
**DOCUMENT ANALYSIS:**
- Type: Wire Transfer
- Reference/ID: WT-2024-001
- Date: 2024-01-15
- Status: Completed

**FINANCIAL SUMMARY:**
- Main Amount: $10,000.00
- Currency: USD
- From: ABC Bank
- To: XYZ Company
- Purpose: Payment for Services
```

- Language preferences

### Customization
To add new financial document types:
1. Update `financial_keywords` list in `detect_financial_document_type()`
2. Add new patterns to the detection logic
3. Update the prompt template if needed

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
1. **Gemini API Failure**: Falls back to local analysis
2. **Local Analysis Failure**: Falls back to basic analysis
3. **Pattern Detection Failure**: Still provides document summary
4. **Database Issues**: Continues with analysis, logs errors

### Logging
- All analysis steps are logged
- Errors are captured with context
- Performance metrics tracked

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Text truncation to 4000 characters for API efficiency
- Cached pattern compilation
- Efficient regex patterns
- Minimal database queries

### Scalability
- Stateless analysis functions
- No external dependencies beyond Gemini
- Efficient memory usage
- Fast pattern matching

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **OCR Integration**: Better text extraction from scanned documents
2. **Machine Learning**: Train custom models for document classification
3. **Template Matching**: Use document templates for better extraction
4. **Validation**: Cross-reference extracted data for accuracy
5. **Export**: Generate structured data exports (JSON, CSV)
