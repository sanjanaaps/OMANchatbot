# RAG Startup Status Fix

## Problem
The startup logs showed "rag=off" even though the application was configured to use RAG, creating confusion about whether RAG was actually available.

## Root Cause
There was an inconsistency between the startup scripts and the main application:

1. **Startup Scripts** (`run.py`, `run_app.py`, `run_with_config.py`):
   - Check for CUDA GPU availability
   - Set `RAG_ENABLED` environment variable to '0' if no GPU, '1' if GPU available
   - Display startup message: `[Startup] device=cpu, rag=off, whisper=base`

2. **Main Application** (`app.py`):
   - Had `RAG_ENABLED = True` hardcoded
   - Ignored the environment variable set by startup scripts
   - This caused confusion between what the startup script reported vs. what the app actually used

## Solution

### ‚úÖ **Fixed Environment Variable Integration**

**Before:**
```python
# app.py - hardcoded value
RAG_ENABLED = True  # Enable by default for hallucination-fixed RAG
```

**After:**
```python
# app.py - respects startup script environment variable
RAG_ENABLED = os.getenv('RAG_ENABLED', '1') == '1'  # Default to enabled if not set
```

### ‚úÖ **Added Startup Logging**

```python
# Log RAG status at startup
print(f"[App] RAG_ENABLED={RAG_ENABLED} (from env: {os.getenv('RAG_ENABLED', 'not set')})")
```

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced RAG Initialization Logging**

```python
def initialize_rag_if_enabled():
    print(f"[App] initialize_rag_if_enabled called - RAG_ENABLED={RAG_ENABLED}")
    
    if RAG_ENABLED:
        # ... initialization code
    else:
        logger.info("üìù RAG functionality disabled - running without RAG")
```

## What You'll See Now

### **With GPU Available:**
```
[Startup] device=cuda, rag=on, whisper=small
[App] RAG_ENABLED=True (from env: 1)
[App] initialize_rag_if_enabled called - RAG_ENABLED=True
‚úÖ Hallucination Fixed RAG system initialized successfully with Falcon model
```

### **Without GPU Available:**
```
[Startup] device=cpu, rag=off, whisper=base
[App] RAG_ENABLED=False (from env: 0)
[App] initialize_rag_if_enabled called - RAG_ENABLED=False
üìù RAG functionality disabled - running without RAG
```

## Benefits

### **1. Consistent Status Reporting**
- ‚úÖ Startup script and app now show the same RAG status
- ‚úÖ No more confusion about whether RAG is enabled
- ‚úÖ Clear indication of why RAG is disabled (no GPU)

### **2. Better Debugging**
- ‚úÖ See exactly what environment variable was set
- ‚úÖ Track RAG initialization process
- ‚úÖ Clear status at each step

### **3. Proper GPU-Based Configuration**
- ‚úÖ RAG automatically disabled on CPU-only systems
- ‚úÖ RAG enabled when GPU is available
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across all startup methods

## Files Modified
- `app.py` - Fixed RAG_ENABLED to respect environment variable and added logging

## Testing

### **Test with GPU:**
1. Run the application on a system with CUDA GPU
2. Verify startup shows `rag=on`
3. Verify app logs show `RAG_ENABLED=True`
4. Confirm RAG system initializes successfully

### **Test without GPU:**
1. Run the application on a CPU-only system
2. Verify startup shows `rag=off`
3. Verify app logs show `RAG_ENABLED=False`
4. Confirm RAG functionality is properly disabled

## Result
- **Consistent Status**: Startup script and app now show matching RAG status
- **Clear Logging**: Easy to see why RAG is enabled/disabled
- **Proper Integration**: Environment variable properly respected
- **Better Debugging**: Complete visibility into RAG initialization process

The startup status now accurately reflects the actual RAG configuration in the application!
